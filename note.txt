Video 89: Storing user data in our app

in the previous video, you store the data in ur database, but now we have to store that data in the 'state' of our application  so we can use it in our app

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        DocumentSnapshot

We get a documentSnapshot object from our documentRefence object

The documentSnapshot object allows us to check if a document exists at this query using
the .exists property which returns a boolean

we can also get the actual properties on the object by calling the .data() method, which returns us a JSON object of the doc
